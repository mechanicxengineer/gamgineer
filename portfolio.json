Built with modular architecture and expressive feedback systems, it integrates advanced animation, responsive combat mechanics, and intelligent enemy behavior—ideal for cinematic action experiences and scalable game development.",
          "Core Systems & Features:",
          "● Third-Person Movement Controller: Smooth camera-relative locomotion with sprinting, crouching, vaulting, and jump states. Includes root motion and physics-based transitions.",
          "● FABRIK-Based Advanced Animation: Real-time inverse kinematics for precise hand and weapon alignment, dynamic aiming, and contextual interactions like climbing and ledge grabbing.",
          "● Health & Damage Architecture: Modular health system with customizable damage types, resistances, and death triggers. Supports both player and AI entities with clean event-driven logic.",
          "● Floating Damage Numbers: Stylized feedback system for hit confirmation. Includes critical hit indicators, scaling animations, and color-coded damage types.",
          "● Weapon Inventory & Switching: Slot-based inventory with support for primary, secondary, and throwable weapons. Includes equip animations and seamless switching logic.",
          "● Firing & Reloading Mechanics: Supports semi-auto, burst, and full-auto fire modes, reload interruptions, and synced ammo updates. Includes dry fire and reload feedback.",
          "● Ammo & Gun UI Indicators: HUD elements for current weapon, ammo count, reload status, and weapon type. Designed for clarity and minimal screen clutter.",
          "● Ammo Collection System: World pickups with contextual prompts, stacking logic, and auto-collect zones. Includes visual and audio feedback.",
          "● Visual Effects Suite: Muzzle flashes, impact sparks, reload particles, and ambient FX. Designed for performance and style using modular VFX components.",
          "● Smart AI Enemies: Behavior-driven AI with patrol, chase, and combat states. Includes line-of-sight detection, cover-seeking, flanking logic, and dynamic reaction to player actions. Supports difficulty scaling and modular behavior trees."],
